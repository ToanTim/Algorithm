- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that assigns unique
numeric codes to represent characters in the English alphabet, as well as punctuation marks, digits, and other
common symbols. In ASCII, each character is represented by a 7-bit binary number, allowing for a total of 128
possible characters.

- ASCII is widely used in programming languages to represent text data. For example, in Java, characters are
represented using the char data type, which is based on ASCII encoding. ASCII codes can be used to perform
various operations on characters, such as comparing them, converting them to uppercase or lowercase, and so on.

- It's worth noting that ASCII is a relatively limited character set and may not be sufficient for representing
text in languages other than English. In such cases, other character encoding standards such as Unicode may be
used instead.
